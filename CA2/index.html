					<h3><a href="#" title="My First Post">LPU Student Innovated A UV Light Racket For Sanitization</a>
					</h3>
				</header>
				<content>
					<p>Recently an LPU student Anant Kumar Rajput who is pursuing B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering has
						developed a decontaminating device built under the direction and guidance of Assistant Professor
						Mandeep Singh and Ruhul Amin Project Officer from Student Research and Project Cell. The novel
						device sanitizes inert surfaces using Ultra Violet (UV) light emitted by rods which are fixed in
						the frame of racket model.

						Now, LPU is looking forward to industrial partnerships to commercialize this excellent
						innovative device which has an estimated mere launch price of 1000 INR for a single racket. LPU
						Chancellor Ashok Mittal has extremely appreciated the tireless working of the research team
						behind this wonderful innovation. He said “We are very proud of the research team for developing
						the portable UV- light racket. The research team worked tirelessly to find a solution to keep
						away COVID-19. I believe that this will gain huge potential in the market world too, once it is
						commercialized.”

					<h3><a href="#" title="Pathway Programme">LPU Students Design Solar-Powered Driverless Bus</a> </h3>
				</header>
				<content>
					<p>Engineering Students at Lovely Professional University (LPU) have designed and created a unique
						solar-powered driverless bus. The bus is slated to enter into commercial service later this year
						and its first prototype will be utilized to welcome and ferry Prime Minister Narendra Modi to
						the venue of world’ largest ‘Indian Science Congress (ISC) 2019 to be inaugurated at LPU campus
						on 3rdJanuary 2019. This, Five-Day 106th edition of ISC 2019 will be held from 3rd to 7th
						January at LPU.
						The design and creation of the bus has been made keeping in mind the Indian conditions, and the
						cost of the bus is approximately Rs 6 lakh. As the bus-engine is powered by both battery and
						solar-cells, so the running cost is almost negligible. With a maximum speed of 30 km per hour,
						it has a seating capacity of 10-30 persons, as per needs. Over 300 students from mechanical,
						electrical, and computer engineering departments of the university collaborated under the
						guidance of LPU professors and experts to design and fabricate the vehicle. The fabrication is
						being done at the LPU Project Studio where other such R&D and product commercialization also
						takes place.
